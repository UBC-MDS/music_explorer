# Motivation and purpose

Our role: Data Analyst Team at a consulting company

Target Audience: Music Enthusiasts(especially Spotify members)

Our sources of listening to songs have evolved over time. From the vintage gramophones through radio, our listening medium has now reached online music-streaming platforms. Spotify, Apple music, Google play etc are some of the most popular of these. Spotify occupies one of the top ranks with a huge music database, over 100 million subscribers and more than one third market share.

Obviously, it is time-consuming and uneasy to find proper music that fits users' interests and tastes. Hence, our dashboard would like to provide a visual platform interface for music enthusiasts, especially Spotify members to explore music trends regarding the songs and the artists, filter high-quality music songs and maybe discover new music in their interested genres, using the Spotify music database.

The spirit of our app is that we would like to create a great exploratory visualization tool for music lovers on Spotify which can save their time and efforts to extract various data they need.

# Description of the data

We will be visualizing a dataset of more than 30000 Spotify music tracks. The release year of the song ranges from 1960 to 2020.  Each song has 23 associated variables that describe its identity (track_id, track_name, track_artist, track_album_id, track_album_name, and track_album_release_date), the popularity (track_popularity), the genre of the song (playlist_name, playlist_genre, playlist_subgenre), and audio features of the song (such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness, etc.)
