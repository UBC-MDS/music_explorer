Motivation and purpose
Our role: Data Analyst Team at a consulting company

Target Audience: Music Enthusiasts(especially Spotify members)

Our sources of listening to songs have evolved. From the vintage gramophones through radio, our listening medium has now transformed to be an online music-streaming platform. Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play, etc are some of the most popular music-streaming platforms. Spotify occupies one of the top ranks with a huge music database, over 100 million subscribers, and more than one-third of the market share.

Obviously, it is time-consuming and complex to find proper music that is customized to fit users' interests and tastes. Hence, our dashboard would like to provide a visual platform interface for music enthusiasts, especially Spotify members to explore music trends of different songs and artists, filter for high-quality music, and maybe discover new music and new genres, using the Spotify music database.

The spirit of our app is that we would like to create an effective and adaptive exploratory visualization tool for music lovers on Spotify which can save their time and efforts to extract various data they need.
