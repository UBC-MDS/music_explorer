# Motivation and purpose

Our role: Data Analyst Team at a consulting company

Target Audience: Music Enthusiasts(especially Spotify members)

Our sources of listening to songs have also evolved over time. From the vintage gramophones through radio, our listening medium has now reached online music-streaming platforms. Spotify, Apple music, Google play etc are some of the most popular of these. Spotify occupies one of the top ranks with a huge music database, over 100 million subscribers and more than one third market share. 

Obviously, it is time-consuming and uneasy to find proper music that fits their interests and tastes. Hence, our dashboard would like to provide a visual platform interface for music enthusiasts, especially Spotify members to explore music trends regarding the songs and the artists, filter high-quality music songs and maybe discover new music in their interested genres, using the Spotify music database. 

The spirit of our app is that we would like to create a great exploratory visualization tool for music lovers on Spotify which can save their time and efforts to extract various data they need.
