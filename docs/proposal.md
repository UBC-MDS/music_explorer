# Motivation and purpose

Our role: Data Analyst Team at a consulting company

Target Audience: Music Enthusiasts(especially Spotify members)

Our sources of listening to songs have evolved over time. From the vintage gramophones through radio, our listening medium has now reached online music-streaming platforms. Spotify, Apple music, Google play etc are some of the most popular of these. Spotify occupies one of the top ranks with a huge music database, over 100 million subscribers and more than one third market share.

Obviously, it is time-consuming and uneasy to find proper music that fits users' interests and tastes. Hence, our dashboard would like to provide a visual platform interface for music enthusiasts, especially Spotify members to explore music trends regarding the songs and the artists, filter high-quality music songs and maybe discover new music in their interested genres, using the Spotify music database.

The spirit of our app is that we would like to create a great exploratory visualization tool for music lovers on Spotify which can save their time and efforts to extract various data they need.

# Description of the data

We will be visualizing a dataset of more than 30000 Spotify music tracks. The release year of the song ranges from 1960 to 2020.  Each song has 23 associated variables that describe its identity (track_id, track_name, track_artist, track_album_id, track_album_name, and track_album_release_date), the popularity (track_popularity), the genre of the song (playlist_name, playlist_genre, playlist_subgenre), and audio features of the song (such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness, etc.)

# Research questions you are exploring
### Research questions:

- What are the top 5 trending genres?
- What is the correlation between music features(loudness, danceability) and popularity?
- what is the song recommendation system given genres and popularity range?

### Scenario of usage:
Lucy enjoys listening to music and she is particularly intruiged by how much music-streaming has developed over the years. She has her own favorite genres and is also open to explore more new genres. However, she is unsure about how her current likings of genres correlate with her likings of new genres which she hasn't explored before. As the music streaming platform advances, she observes that there are usually customized recommendations, therefore she is curious as to how the music streaming platforms may or may not accurately predict her likings. Moreover, as a young women with taste in genres that are typically considered not of the young generation, she is also curious about whether age is an effective predictor for genre likings of music lovers in general. 

Puzzling about these questions, she is interested in an app that offers insights that can solve her puzzling thoughts. When she uses "music explorer", not only can she identify the list of genres trending now, she can also see the correlation and disassociation between genres visually summarized in graphs and tables. This can help her better understand whether or not a music-streaming app is accurate in their customized recommendations. Moreover, she can also discover predictors of genre interests, and confirm her question about age.
